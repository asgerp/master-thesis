Hi Asger and Kristoffer.

Here are some comments on your draft. In addition to the more low level annotations, I have the following comments:

* You need to relate and distinguish projects. You don't do that very much in the current version. You need to create an overview of the literature for the reader. Take us by the hand and give us a carefully planned, guided tour through previous projects.

I agree here with Esben. It is a really thin line to walk between solely giving a list of what has been done (this is somewhat the state in your document right now), and a 'guided tour' (as Esben puts it) through what exists, but how it relates. Simply telling what exists without stating how it relates does not help much. Since the work is related, it has to become clear how it is related to what you are doing (on a conceptual level - not on a technical level, since your work uses technology rather than invents it).


* I think you could get a more clear related work chapter, if you think more about which glasses you use to look at the literature. Is it the technical glasses now? Then the empirical glasses? It would be perfectly fine to first create an overview of technology, then move on the provide an overview of applications, and then studies. Or however, you see fit.

Again, here I agree, and I do have an opinion about it: the important thing is (see previous point) to decide on which level you want to relate your work to others. As stated before, you're not really inventing new technology, but rather making use of technology to explore a new concept. So, for example, talking about which sensors (e.g., Kinect vs. Anoto vs. Depth Cameras, etc.) they used in which project might be somewhat irrelevant, but what they used it for is important (e.g., a digital pen to create ad hoc interfaces). I am personally leaning towards using the concept (with a mix of some empirical discussion/presentation) in your related work section.


Overall, you need to put some more effort into this.
The related work is a very important chapter as it makes readers understand where you are situated in the current landscape of research - and it tells where you are different (or what you build on top to bring the field one step ahead). So, as Esben puts it perfectly, you have to work hard on this chapter. And you have to do early on as it defines your project (or at least refines it). Could you actually send us a list of papers that you have been reading? This would give us a better understanding of which direction you are going to with this chapter.
